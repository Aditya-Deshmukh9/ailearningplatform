    ðŸ”· Banner Image Prompt:
    Create a modern, flat-style **3D digital illustration** representing the user's course topic. Include UI/UX elements such as mockup screens, text blocks, icons, buttons, and creative workspace tools. Add symbolic elements related to the course, like sticky notes, design components, and visual aids. Use a vibrant color palette (blues, purples, oranges) with a clean, professional look.
